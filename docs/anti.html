    <p>Anti is your friendly neighborhoud typeface.
Being very intrigued by grotesque designs, signs and letterings I combined different characteristics I found throughout my research to create a new, unique but still familiar look and feel.</p>
<p>Having the right amount of personality it is perfect for headlines while at the same time being a sturdy companion for body text as well.</p>
<p>It’s currently a work in progress looking at an extension of the glyph set to support as many languages using the latin alphabet as possible.</p>
