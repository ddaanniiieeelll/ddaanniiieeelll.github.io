    <p>Simulator is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games. Simulator is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems or human systems to gain insight into their functioning, as in economics. Simulator can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. Simulator is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.</p>
