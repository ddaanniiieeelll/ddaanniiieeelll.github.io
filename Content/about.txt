# About me
Hello, I'm Daniel and I'm a type designer / font engineer.
I graduated 2019 at [HBKsaar](https://hbksaar.de/) with a diploma in communication design.
My focus was already on type design and I deepened that knowledge with internships at [DaltonMaag](https://www.daltonmaag.com) and [Alphabet Type](http://www.alphabet-type.com).
I am currently working as a freelance designer / engineer or as a paramedic, depending on where Iâ€™m needed.
