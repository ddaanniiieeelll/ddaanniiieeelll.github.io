    <p>Anti is your friendly neighborhoud typeface.
Being very intrigued by grotesque designs, signs and letterings I combined different characteristics I found throughout my research to create a new, unique but still familiar look and feel.
It’s quite versatile, working well as a body typeface as well as for headlines and comes in 3 weights: Light, Regular and Bold.</p>
